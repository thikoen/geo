This repository acts as a "plug and play" solution just for trying out the Geo Webapp.
To start the app you NEED you have Docker installed on your local machine.
After running the runGeo script you can reach the app under localhost:3000, Email:"admin@test.com", Password:"12345678"

It does not include the actual source code, which you can find in GeoFE and GeoBE.

This Projects was a collaboration with a few other students from HSRM / Wiesbaden. 

My role included: Architecture, backend programming with expressJS, designing UI Assets and developing style guides, DevOps services such as developing build pipeline, dockerization, etc.

Big shoutout to the nice people I had the pleasure to work with!
